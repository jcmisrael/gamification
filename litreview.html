    Gamification is a matter of causes and effects. When employed in academia it is viewed from two diametrically opposite sides of a relationship. This relationship, and how both parties view and interact each other and the gamified curriculum, is integral to understanding how gamification affects both parties and how they can maximize the benefits of employing such methodologies.

    Firstly, as it often is, comes the examination of games from the perspective of the student. In their examination of games in education, Kurt Squire and Henry Jenkins take the implementation of gamification in a curriculum as almost devoid of affection from the educator. In their opening example analogizing the use of games in education to that of Orson Scott Card’s Ender’s Game, they make note of how “Teachers play almost no overt role in the process, shaping the children’s development primarily through the recruitment of players, the design  of game rules, and the construction of contested spaces.” (Squire, Jenkins 2003). This grossly underestimates the role of the educator in this scenario, but functions as a starting point for their examination of games in education from a students perspective. Published in 2003, their examination of games as educational tools falls a bit more literally than what modern day theorists mean when they discuss gamification, but serves as an ample starting point for understand the values of gamification.

    Squire and Jenkins make use of gamification through the literal inclusion of video games as educational tools. Games such as Civilization, SimCity, and Railroad Tycoon are proposed as viable tools at the disposal of educators. By leveraging the interactivity, variable outcome, and competition within these games they hope to increase students intrinsic motivation to learn. They propose three theoretical case studies in which the aid of video games increase students drive to learn. In their first example students use Civilization III to study history. The variable starting conditions and outputs, along with the mechanics of the game serve to help the students understand the history of nations, and the importance of multiple facets of history such as geography and politics and the intertwining nature they have with one another. Due to the nature of the game they are then able to explore alternative histories.  This is an excellent example of a learner-content interactions, as how the students interact with the content, in this case the video game, directly impacts their intrinsic motivation, and the possibility of self-exploration and creation of histories within the game gives way to personal attachment to the video games outcomes. They then expand upon the benefits of video games in their second case study, introducing a learner-learner interaction through a game called Revolution. In this game players take on the roles of Colonial Americans, and through their interactions with one another and the game they learn about Colonial American history. All of these theoretical case studies involve many of the learner-learner, learner-content, and even learner-instructor interactions discussed by Wei and Chang. While their analysis was in regards to modern day MOOC’s, the parallels to relatively simplistic inclusion of video games as a form of gamification is clear.

    In her work “Gamification in Education”, Susan Sandusky takes a similar look at gamification from the standpoint of a student. In it she looks at intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and gamification of not just the learning process, but the application of the knowledge for gamified tests and homework assignments. Intrinsic motivation was mentioned before , but is only now expanded upon. “ Intrinsic motivation is when learners are interested in what they learn and in the learning process itself (Buckley & Doyle, 2014). Extrinsic motivation is learners engage in learning because it is a means to an end, relatively disassociated from the content and subject of learning (Buckley & Doyle, 2014).” (Sandusky 2015). She goes on to say that the ultimate goal of gamification is to increase intrinsic motivation. This can be conflated with the results garnered from case studies where the results of students grades at the end of their term directly tied to their intrinsic motivation. Sandusky herself takes a look at a few case studies on gamification, heading towards the conclusion that intrinsic motivation is key to gamification, but extrinsic motivation is a risk imposed by the design of the game. Here the true benefits and perils of the implementations of gamification can be seen. In some of the case studies she examines, game elements are introduced to students daily activities. In the first study she looked at by Buckley and Doyle, students bought and sold contracts for imaginary currency. This use of currency and peer to peer interaction leads to motivation via the methodologies discussed by Wei and Chang. Furthermore in the empirical study performed by Hamari et al. in Does Gamification Work? they identified that points and leaderboards are among the most researched and used means of gamification, and usually incur positive results. Sandusky goes on to look at gamification of testing, and homework. By adding clear goals set by game elements such as achievements and point systems, students took a more active part fulfilling the given achievements via academic success. This intrinsic motivation and rapid feedback shows positive results for the affected parties.

    Finally in James Gee analysis of part of his book, What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy, he talks about some of the benefits of games from a students perspective. He puts forth video games as models for traits in real life. They reproduce those traits within their players. By identifying a cycle of expertise within a game that a user must go through, it functions as a model of expertise for users to learn from, even subconsciously. “Good games are models for the production of expertise.” (Gee 2003). He goes on to say that motivation is the most important factor to drive learning, and that games themselves are highly motivating. These add on to the views of gamification from the eyes of players.

    But not only is gamification important as viewed from a student's perspective, but equally important from an educator's perspective. Gamification is a tool with which educators can improve the quality of their curriculum, but requires strong participation from their end as well. While in the simpler example of gamification proposed by Squire and Jenkins earlier on they dismissed the teacher's role in applying games and gamification to education, the mere act of deciding which games, or how to gamify education, is a crucial step in the process of implementing and benefiting from gamification for both student and educator. While many of the case studies previously looked at show generally positive outcomes, looking at the stats produced by Hamari et al. show that gamification largely leads to only partially positive tests. Rarely does it result in entirely positive results. In Sandusky’s research in Gamification in Education, she finds cases where when the case is that extrinsic motivation presides over intrinsic motivation, neutral or negative results occur. By poorly applying gamification to academic scenarios, educators can introduce bad habits and hurt their students in the long term. This shift into extrinsic motivation is often found to be an issue with the design of the game elements within the curriculum. Thus the relationship between an educator's interpretation and implementation of gamification, and a students are strongly and linearly tied. To reap the positive benefits of gamification, large amounts of effort must first be put into properly teaching the educator the proper methodology to implementing and using gamification. So while the concept of gamification in education seeks to be of greater benefit to student than teacher, the study of gamification in education is itself for the benefit of the teacher. Bohyun Kim’s Designing Gamification in the Right Way seeks to aid in a deeper understanding of the underlying methodology behind gamification. She recognizes from the start “gamification is still seen as a relatively new and experimental strategy” (Kim 2015). The empirical study of Hamari et al. identifies key elements of games that are most used and loosely associated with their effectiveness. Chang and Wei further analyze specific game mechanics and report on their engagement, determining which contribute most overall. All of this analysis on game mechanics and the proper methodology for gamification can be taken as gamification from the view of the educator, as the educator now takes on the role of game designer. The rules governed by the designer function as the foundation for how students will react to and interact with them. A poor game designer implementing a poor set of rules will only result in mediocre responses from the student.

    After looking at gamification from the perspectives of both students and educators, now further known to be partially game designers when dealing with gamification, we can see the current environment that games hold in academia. From the earlier studies done by Jenkins and Squire we get a simpler view of games as separate entities. Much like the textbooks used by students everywhere they function as a medium not a methodology for education. The transition of game from medium to methodology occurs later, and brings about the concept of gamification. As various technologies get more and more incorporated into education so to will gaming. The rise of “smart” technologies such as smart whiteboards allow for easier tracking and integration of gamification in schools. Some schools require laptops or tablet computers for their students. These technologies all help to build games as integral parts to education by deeply rooting them within the confines of academic buildings and locations. While as noted out by Bohyun Kim that gamification is still new and experimental, it’s clear from current available case studies that it offers worthwhile benefits. Gee seeks to further the integration of video games by identifying and exemplifying worthwhile traits present in games. Outside education the status of video games for gamification is ever increasing. Multiple authors make note of its use in military service (Squire, Jenkins 2003) and in medical aid to help persons with specific illnesses recuperate using the mental or physical aspects of games and gamification.
