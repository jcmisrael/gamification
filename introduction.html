    Gamification in the academic environment is an inevitability, and a valuable asset to be employed by educators everywhere. Based around numerous studies taken out by academic scholars, gamification of education and learning in academia has proven to be a beneficial practice, and has seen rapid adoption rates. By looking at the works of Gee, Squire, and others we can deduce the path that gamification must take, its benefits, and its downsides. Within the purview of this examination of gamification we’ll look at its implications from the perspective of the pedagogue and that of their students. Furthermore we’ll examine the proper implementation of gamification in educational environments, and its future as a tool to advance the pursuit of knowledge and edification. The examination of these aspects of gamification will be done by analysis of the scholarly works already present on gamification, and by cross examination of various case studies performed by these scholars.

    Firstly, it is important to distinguish between gamification with regards to the educator, and with regards to the student. The educator takes the place of the game creator and designer, while the student takes  position of the competitor. Thus  it is up to the educator to implement the gamification in such a way as to maximize the benefit to the student. This is done by maximizing intrinsic motivation (Sandusky 2015). By maximizing intrinsic motivation, as opposed to extrinsic motivation, the student is more likely to adopt the learning itself as opposed to the game. This allows for continued education should the gamification be reduced or removed, and to better allow the student to transfer his habits and knowledge of learning to other areas which have yet to employ these methodologies. Viewed from the perspective of the student, he interacts with the game and gameplay itself. The game aspects can manifest themselves in multiple formats. In the study of massive online open courses, or MOOCs, Jen-Wei Chang and Hung-Yu Wei settle on three relationships proposed by Michael Moore to differentiate aspects of gamification: learner-content interaction, learner-learner interaction, and learner-instructor interaction. These distinct forms of interaction are different design spaces for gamification, and all involve the learner but in different ways.

    Furthermore we’ll examine the implementation of gamification in academic environments. As a new area of study the proper implementation of gamification in academia is crucial in properly maximizing the benefits it has to offer (Kim 2015). Many of the works and analysis done by Gee, Sandusky, and other scholars studying the area of gamification discuss how the concept of applying game concepts to education has benefits, but improper application of these can reduce many of these benefits, or result in harm to the students education over a long term. As implementer of the game, the educator takes on the role of game designer and must understand the intricacies of designing a game to maximize its benefits. The studies involved in quantifying the benefits of different mechanics for gamifying education are present but sparse. An overview by Hamari et al. in “Does Gamification Work?” will be used as a general basis for the quantification and statistics of gamification as a whole, and specifics on its implementation.

    Finally we’ll look at the current state of gamification by cross examining different case studies and scholarly works. This will be a normative look at gamification in the current educational environment. By re-examining past studies in the context of new studies and information, a reassessment of the conclusions brought about by their authors can be made. Thus new insights can be ascertained by reexamining such past works.Gamification in the academic environment is an inevitability, and a valuable asset to be employed by educators everywhere.
