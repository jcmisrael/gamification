    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>Gamification is a rising methodology for teaching in academia. A result of ever increasing immersion in technology and data analysis, gamification will better allow us to find intrinsic motivation within our work. But it's not merely a question of whether or not we should study and practice these methodologies, but how we will when they inevitably find their way into our lives. This research project attempts to collect and analyse information on gamification in academia to better understand it.</p>
