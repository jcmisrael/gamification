<h1 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 200%;">Conclusion</h1>

<p>
    Gamification is a young and relatively unexplored area of study. It has been shown to have positive impacts on areas it is applied in, but still has a few pitfalls to be overcome to ensure its applicability. But it is certain that it is coming. With the convergence of technology and social awareness of such technology the general flow of design is heading towards a gamified life. It’s broad appeal, generally beneficial effects, and emergence from technological immersion guarantee its place in society. With proper study and teaching to those who wish to implement it into their academic lives or elsewhere it will serve as a powerful tool to enhance student motivation and retention. With great benefits to those that wish to use it for ethically good or bad purposes, it will certainly be employed where it can cause large changes within society.
