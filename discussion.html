    It’s now apparent that gamification is important to both educators and educatees. Class sizes, population, and student diversity continue to grow at alarming rates. With the influx of students into forms of higher education, new tools must be brought forward to enhance the education system itself. While wide scale reforms in many areas are required, implementation of known positive outcome methodologies serve only to better us as a society. Furthermore through empirical study we can see that the results of gamification are quantifiable, and individuals portions and mechanics present within gamified society can be compared and analysed. As such we can discern through trial and error proper or improper mechanics. To better understand how to properly maximize the benefits of the methodology more data must be acquired through case study and practical application.

    Furthermore by looking at various case studies and instances of practical application in the medical fields it becomes evident that gamification works regardless of age range and certain other factors for the most part. Similar results can be found when the methodology is applied across all levels of education, and in other fields such as medicine. Children and adults of all ages benefit from the introduction of gamification into their daily lives. This ubiquity lends to the inevitability of gamification. The current generation is at the forefront of people who were raised with gaming, in particular video gaming, as a daily occurrence in the household and completely comfortable with the associated technologies. Whether or not the benefits of gameplay are inherent to gameplay itself and enjoyable by everyone is a different topic, but was is clear is that gamified life is the preference.

    Additionally the technology surrounding gaming itself is becoming more ubiquitous, and advancing far enough to not be distracting in everyday life.  With the advent of wearable technology such as smartwatches it’s becomes practically impossible to avoid gamified life for anyone moderately embracing personal technology, and exponentially harder for any within a public, non-rural or impoverished, area. Although non-digital forms of gamification also exist in the form of food reward cards. While we’re still a few years off an Orwellian society of ever watching cameras attached to everyone's eyeglasses, the issues such events propose must be faced presently.

Finally the ethical dilemmas of gamification must be addressed. By establishing the methods as generally positive we introduce the possibility for an education gap for those that don’t or cannot employ such methods. While technology lowers in price by the day some struggling countries may not be able to reap the rewards without help. Adding gameplay to parts of our everyday lives could also have adverse ethical consequences. With games employing many Skinner box tactics such as pattern repetition it’s entirely possible to dictate what a person does by altering the rules they follow.  These methods increase an individual's intrinsic motivation to perform a task, therefore we must ensure that they should be performing the specific task itself.
